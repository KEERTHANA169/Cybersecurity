#### 1. Network Security
- Protects the integrity of the network and data.
- Safeguards the data and network's usefulness.

#### 2. Basic File and Directory Management (Linux/Unix)
- `ls -la`: List all files (including hidden ones) with details.
- `cd /path/to/directory`: Change directory.
- `pwd`: Print current directory.
- `mkdir directory_name`: Create a new directory.
- `rm filename`: Remove a file.
- `rm -r directory_name`: Remove a directory and its contents.
- `cp source destination`: Copy files/directories.
- `mv old_name new_name`: Move or rename a file/directory.
- `touch filename`: Create an empty file.

#### 3. Tools in Cybersecurity (for Windows)
- **Fing**: Network discovery (MAC address, IP address, etc.).
- **Angry IP**: IP scanning tool for Windows.
- **Advanced IP Scanner**: Scans and lists live IPs around.
- **MAC Address Changer**: Tool to change MAC addresses.

#### 4. Cables
- **RJ45**: Connects devices to LAN, uses 8 pins.
- **RJ45 Color Code**: Pin 1-4: White/Orange, Orange, White/Green, Blue (Signal: TX1+, TX1, RX+, TX2+).

#### 5. Stateful Packet Inspection (SPI)
- Tracks TCP/UDP sessions and keeps connection info in state session table.
- Temporary holes opened for returning traffic in the firewall.
- Detects half-open session attacks.

#### 6. Proxying
- Acts as a middle-man for communication.
- Caches local copies of external data.
- Offers services like logging, content filtering, and authentication.

#### 7. Network Address Translation (NAT)
- **Public Address**: Routed on the internet, must be configured.
- **Private Address**: Used within organizations. 

This is a high-level overview of network security topics, basic command management, cybersecurity tools, cables, packet inspection, proxying, and NAT.
