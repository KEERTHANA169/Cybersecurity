#### **Steps in the Data Recovery Process**

**Step 1: Open Recovery Tool**  
Initiate the data recovery process by opening a reliable recovery tool designed for disk imaging and file recovery.

**Step 2: Select Recovery Mode**  
Choose the appropriate recovery mode. For this process, select "Disk Image Creation" to create a backup image of the drive before proceeding with data recovery.

**Step 3: Identify the Target Drive**  
Identify the drive containing the lost or deleted files. This step ensures that the correct drive is selected for imaging and recovery.

**Step 4: Configure Disk Image Settings**  
Configure the settings for disk image creation. This includes choosing the type of image, the destination for the image file, and any compression options if available.

**Step 5: Choose File Directory**  
Select the directory where the disk image will be saved. This directory should have sufficient storage space to accommodate the image file.

**Step 6: Disk Image Creation and Proceed**  
Proceed with the creation of the disk image. This process involves copying all data from the selected drive to the image file, preserving the current state of the drive.

**Step 7: Select Drive Image and Volume for Recovery**  
Once the disk image is created, load the image into the recovery tool. Select the specific volume within the image where data recovery will be attempted.

**Step 8: Choose Quick Recovery**  
Opt for the "Quick Recovery" mode. This mode is designed to quickly scan the selected volume for recoverable files without a deep or exhaustive scan.
