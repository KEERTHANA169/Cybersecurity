## Cryptography Lab Exercises and Network Security Tasks

### Lab 1: Proxy Lab (Exercise 1)
#### Scenario:
When you visit a website, numerous requests are made in the background. The goal is to intercept and analyze these requests and responses by setting up a proxy filter.

#### Objective:
To capture and inspect the web traffic requests and responses.

#### Tools Required:
- Burp Suite

#### Tasks:
1. Install Burp Suite and set up the CA certificate.
2. Configure Burp Suite as a proxy for your browser.
3. Analyze the incoming and outgoing traffic.

#### Steps:
1. Establish a proxy connection between your browser and ISP.
2. Obtain and install the CA certificate.
3. Set up the proxy on your browser.
4. Monitor the data traffic.
5. Categorize and examine the requests and responses.

#### Output:
Provide screenshots of the captured traffic.

### Lab 2: OSI Model Traffic Filtering (Exercise 2)
#### Scenario:
When working with networking components and the internet, you encounter numerous IP addresses and protocols. This exercise uses the OSI model to filter data traffic based on different protocols.

#### Objective:
To capture and filter HTTP, HTTPS, and other protocol-based traffic by IP address.

#### Tools Required:
- Wireshark

#### Tasks:
1. Capture network traffic using Wireshark.
2. Apply filters to inspect specific traffic types such as HTTP and HTTPS.

#### Steps:
1. Open a new or previously saved Wireshark capture file.
2. Apply relevant display filters for traffic.
3. Analyze the filtered packets.

#### Output:
Include screenshots showcasing the filtered traffic.

### Lab 3: Network Simulation using Cisco Packet Tracer (Exercise 3)
#### Scenario:
Before physically configuring an office network, it’s vital to simulate and virtually test it. In this lab, you will use Cisco Packet Tracer to connect multiple PCs in a local area network (LAN).

#### Objective:
To set up a basic LAN with five PCs using Cisco Packet Tracer.

#### Tools Required:
- Cisco Packet Tracer

#### Tasks:
1. Select the appropriate routers, switches, and PCs for the network.
2. Configure IP addresses for devices in two LANs.

#### Steps:
1. Open Cisco Packet Tracer and add the necessary devices.
2. Assign IP addresses to the PCs in both LANs.
3. Set up a routing configuration for both networks.

#### Output:
Provide IP configurations and screenshots of the network simulation.

### Lab 4: Cryptography Techniques (Exercise 4)
#### Scenario:
In this lab, you will encrypt and decrypt messages using fundamental cryptographic techniques to ensure the security of communication.

#### Objective:
To understand encryption and decryption methods in cryptography.

#### Tools Required:
1. Caesar Cipher
2. Vigenère Cipher
3. AES Encryption

#### Tasks:
1. Encrypt and decrypt a simple message using a Caesar Cipher.
2. Apply the Vigenère Cipher to another message using a keyword.
3. Use AES encryption to secure a message.

#### Steps:
1. Encrypt and decrypt a message using the Caesar Cipher, where letters are shifted.
2. Use the Vigenère Cipher by shifting letters based on a keyword.
3. Secure a message using the AES encryption algorithm.

#### Output:
Provide the encrypted and decrypted messages for each cipher.
